# Signal Strength Project
This project was done for the Bootcamp: Java class taught during intersession at Johns Hopkins University. It asks the user for a file with a certain template (valid1.txt), which contains information about the number of rows and columns that divide rooms (each cell being 1 room). It also has information on the wall features of each room. Then, the user also provides location of a router emitting signals. The program then calculates, based on the wall information, the signal strength in each room through an iterative process involving (a) calculating FSPL, and (b) calculating attenuation rate.

The Cell.java and parts of Proj1.java scripts were provided, and my contribution was completing a majority (9 methods) of the Proj1.java folder.
